# Sean Peters

I've been interested in tech for as long as I can remember, and first started programming at primary school (BASIC on an Acorn Archimedes in case you're wondering). My first ever job was as a web developer (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL), and then I worked at Apple for several years. After that I started a career in internal comms, but I missed the tech world and decided it was time to pursue software engineering as a career. Having completed an intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy and worked on loads of interesting projects, I’m now looking for a role as a junior software developer.

## Skills

I've developed a range of skills during my time working in internal comms roles, and while working at Apple, that are highly relevant to the world of software development.

### Communication
Working in internal communications has made me an excellent communicator, not only within my own team and the wider organisation, but with external audiences as well.

At a basic level, I'm always conscious of making sure all relevant stakeholders are involved in the conversation. I implement effective methods for updating team members on what I'm working on, and regularly seek input and feedback to make sure everything stays on track.

But more importantly, I'm able to craft a story and articulate a vision. In my internal comms roles, stakeholders would come to be with something that needed to be communicated to the rest of the business. I'd start by breaking the issue down to understand what it was really about, and often this would involve quickly learning about topics that I had no prior knowledge of. I'd then work with the stakeholders to create a narrative around what this meant for colleagues in the wider organisation.

### Planning, prioritisation and stakeholder management
I'm great at breaking a project down into actionable parts, and then creating a robust plan to help me prioritise my workload.

In any organisation, there's always new information that people want to communicate, but employees can only digest a finite amount of updates. A large part of an internal comms team's role is acting as a filter for that information, and prioritising what to say and when based on the wider business priorities.

This inevitably involves having to push back on some lower-priority projects, or adjust plans to communicate things at a more appropriate time. By building strong relationships with stakeholders throughout the business, I'm able to have honest conversations and explain the reasoning behind why I think we should approach a project in a particular way.

### Problem solving
Problem solving has always been one of my key strengths, and is something that's been central to all my previous jobs.

At Apple, I constantly had to solve technical prolems and help customers fix hardware and software issues. Often there wouldn't be an obvious solution, so I had to use a methodical troubleshooting approach, research answers in technical documents, and collaborate with colleagues to come up with a resolution.

Another example happened when I was leading internal comms at ao.com when the first UK Covid lockdown was announced. This presented a huge challenge, as the business had always been heavily office-based, and we didn't have any good channels to communicate with remote employees.

We'd been planning to roll out Yammer and Microsoft Teams over the next 6–9 months, and we ended up doing it within 3 weeks instead. I led the team that set up the platforms, localised them for the countries that we operated in, and produced the communications to help employees understand how to use them.

Within a month, we went from only being able to communicate with people by email, to running live, CEO-led Yammer events with over 2,000 employees attending.

## Education
