# Sean Peters

I've been into tech for as long as I can remember, and first started programming at primary school (BASIC on an Acorn Archimedes in case you're wondering). After working at Apple for several years, I started a career in internal comms. But I missed the tech world and decided it was time to pursue software engineering as a career. Having completed an intensive bootcamp with Makers Academy, I’m now looking for my first software development role.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Planning


#### Teamwork and building relationships

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

#### Another skill


## Education

- An intensive bootcamp focused on equipping developers with the skills to go straight into a junior developer role and be able to make a valuable contribution to any team.
- Worked with: JavaScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, HTML, CSS, Ruby, RSpec, Postgres, MongoDB.
- Acquired a solid foundation in core programming concepts and developer process, allowing me to quickly learn new languages and technologies.
- Developed a strong understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles, helping me write well-tested and high-quality code.
- Collaborated daily through pair programming sessions and group projects, gaining expertise in Agile workflows, planning techniques, and effective teamwork.
